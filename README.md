# RL-based-pole-balancer
This is a small step towards the start of re-enforcement based pole balancer which is recommended for everyone

Test Random Environment with Gym
The initial step involves testing the pole balancer in a random environment using Gym, a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.


Create a DeepLearning model with Keras
Utilizing Keras, a high-level neural networks API, a deep learning model is constructed. This model will be crucial for training the agent to effectively balance the pole.


Build Agent with keras RL
The reinforcement learning agent is developed using Keras RL (Reinforcement Learning for Keras). This library provides a set of high-level APIs for implementing and customizing reinforcement learning models.
